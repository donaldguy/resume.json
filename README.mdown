# Donald Guy's resume information as JSON

  * things which exist independent of him are broken out into their own 
    (reusable?) representations, with web urls wherever relevant.
    Apparently:
      + Legal entities which exist go in the `world` directory
      + Things which one "can learn" go in the `skills` directory
  * Every such things is assigned a unique key. This will make these possibly
    usable in a flat key-value store?
  * Information pertaining to Donald specifically is in the top level `donaldguy-resume.json` file.
